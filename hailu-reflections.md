###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I didn't Uderstund(very well) pull requests and the Git Cycle.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* Git workflow got a lot clear after the GPS session.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  * Do i (in a work environment) merge pull requests?
        
`Answer: I have to let the reviewer merge them unless told to do so`
  
  * How often do i have to do pushes to origin?
        
`Answer: Every 30 minutes is a good practice`
  
  * are all branches feature branches?

`Almost all branches are feature branches.`

###What still confuses you about Git?

  * What happens to feature branches after merging to master branch? because i see, they don't disappear after a full git cycle

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I had a very memorable experience! i had time to ask most of the questions i had over the week. it was very cool to know there is someone to help if i had any problems with my work. 

P.S. I learned a lot of cool shortcuts for GitBash and Markdown.
